  description: |
    We believe every researcher should know how to write short programs that clean and analyze data in a reproducible way and how to use version control to keep track of what they have done. But just as some astronomers spend their careers designing telescopes, some researchers focus on building the software that makes research possible. People who do this are called research software engineers; the aim of this book is to get you ready for this role by helping you go from writing code for yourself to creating tools that help your entire field advance.

Next you will learn to use the API for tabular data and get an overview of the types of plots you can generate and how to customize them; including how to customize interactivity using widgets. Next is an overview on how to display and save plots in the notebook, on the commandline, and from a script. Another section will introduce you to generating subplots from your data. Once the basics are covered you can learn how to use the plotting API for specific types of data including streaming data, gridded data network graphs, geographic data, and timeseries data.

We'll introduce basic array syntax and array indexing, review some of the available mathematical functions in NumPy, and discuss how to write your own routines. Along the way, we'll learn just enough about matplotlib to display results from our examples.

    Examples of how wrf-python can be used to make plots with matplotlib (with basemap and cartopy) and PyNGL. None of these examples make use of xarray’s builtin plotting functions, since additional work is most likely needed to extend xarray in order to work correctly.

    xarray (formerly xray) is an open source project and Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!

    Xarray introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates and attributes on top of raw NumPy-like arrays, which allows for a more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone developer experience. The package includes a large and growing library of domain-agnostic functions for advanced analytics and visualization with these data structures.

    Xarray is inspired by and borrows heavily from pandas, the popular data analysis package focused on labelled tabular data. It is particularly tailored to working with netCDF files, which were the source of xarray’s data model, and integrates tightly with dask for parallel computing.
